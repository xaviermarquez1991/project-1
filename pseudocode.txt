Game Logic Begins

2. if 'hit' is clicked, a third card appers next to the others
3. data checks to see if the user cards has a value of 21 or less
4. if not, prompt "YOU BUSTED"
5. if so, the user can continue to click 'hit' or 'stay'
6. if 'stay' is hit then the user value is set.
7. dealer's turn begins
8. Dealer's hidden card flips over and is now visible
9. if the dealers cards result in a  value of 16 or less, then the dealer 'hits'
10. data checks to see if dealers value is >= 17 OR <=21  
11. if not, the dealer has busted, prompt appears "User wins"
12. if so, the data checks the dealers value against the users value, the larger number wins.
13. If user wins, prompt "USER WINS"
14. If dealer wins, prompt "DEALER WINS"
15. click game reset button to start again.
